## Introduction

This is a simple frontend created with Angular and MaterialUI to show off as a personal site and perhaps a bit of a blog and for details of my resume. It is a work in progress and will be updated as I learn more about Angular and MaterialUI.

I chose MaterialUI because Google has spent so much time researching and refining it. It is my very favorite UI and I love the rounded edges and the subtle clean animations. I also like yellow and orange, so will certainly be butchering the color pallets (Probably against their design philosophy)
